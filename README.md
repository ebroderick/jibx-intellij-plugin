Modified verison of Jerome Bernard's jibx intellij plugin that works with intellij 12 & 13 (http://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/239?pr=).

All dependencies are already available under lib. To build, open the project in intellij and hit "Prepare Plugin Module 'jibx-intellij-plugin' For Deployment from the 'Build' menu. (I've only tried this with intellij 12.)

After installing the plugin, right click "binding.xml" files and select "Use as JiBX Binding" from the menu.
